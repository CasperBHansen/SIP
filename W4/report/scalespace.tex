\section{Scale-space Operators}

\subsection{Convolution Theorem}
To show that $G(x,y,\sigma) * G(x,y,\tau) = G(x,y,\sqrt{\sigma^2 + \tau^2})$
are equivalent I tried to match on the pixels for one-to-one equivalency using
the \code{ginput} tool. Although they are very close, I found that they didn't
match perfectly. I think this is due to how the convolution is carried out, as
it seems to shift the entire image 1--2 pixels toward the upper-left, and
hence some variance in the result might be expected. To counter this, I also
tried the alternative built-in \code{conv2} method, but this produced a
similar result.

(right)}

As can be seen in figure (\ref{fig:convolve-thm}) the results using window
size of $50$, and letting $\sigma = 5$ and $\tau = 2$ we see almost no
difference in the appearance of the two filter kernels. The code used to
produce the figure above can be reviewed in section
\ref{appendix:convolve-thm}. Note that I have tried to account for the
shifting behavior described.

\subsection{Scale Normalized Derivatives}

\subsubsection{Analytical expression}
I'm not quite sure what is meant by analytical expression, so I'v reduced the
equation into discrete form --- hopefully this is what was asked for.

\begin{align}
    H(x,y,\tau)
    &= I_{xx}(x,y,\tau) + I_{yy}(x,y,\tau)
     = \tau^{\gamma(2+0)} \frac{\partial^2 I(x,y,\tau)}{\partial x^2}
     + \tau^{\gamma(0+2)} \frac{\partial^2 I(x,y,\tau)}{\partial y^2} \\
    &= \tau^2 \frac{\partial^2 I(x,y,\tau)}{\partial x^2}
     + \tau^2 \frac{\partial^2 I(x,y,\tau)}{\partial y^2}
     = \tau^2 \left[ \frac{\partial^2 I(x,y,\tau)}{\partial x^2}
     + \frac{\partial^2 I(x,y,\tau)}{\partial y^2} \right] \\
    &= \tau^2 \left[
       I(x+1,y,\tau)
     + I(x-1,y,\tau)
     - 4 I(x,y,\tau)
     + I(x,y+1,\tau)
     + I(x,y-1,\tau)
       \right]
%    &= \tau^2 \left[
%       I(x,y) * G(x+1,y,\tau)
%     + I(x,y) * G(x-1,y,\tau)
%     - 4 I(x,y) * G(x,y,\tau)
%     + I(x,y) * G(x,y+1,\tau)
%     + I(x,y) * G(x,y-1,\tau)
%       \right] \\
%    &= \tau^2 \sum_{i=I_{min}}^{I_{max}}\sum_{j=J_{min}}^{J_{max}}
%       \left[ I(x + i, y + i, \tau) \right]
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Scales}
After fighting with MatLab for many hours, I had to give in to this. I failed
to produce the values of $\tau$ sought after. My attempt, as it looks at this
time can be found in \ref{appendix:scale-extremals}.

%\begin{align}
%    I(x,y,\tau) = I(x,y) * \left( \frac{1}{2\pi\tau^2}e^{-\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2\tau^2}} \right)
%\end{align}
