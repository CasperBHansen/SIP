\section{Feature Extraction}
After a bit of twisting and tweaking of the knobs involved in the pipeline I
ended up using, I arrived at a pipeline that; produces a gray-scale image of
the image, detects the edges of the gray-scale version by subtracting a
dilated from an eroded version of it, and then closed.

Each step of the pipeline is shown in figure \ref{fig:6a} below.

I did try to perform thickening, but I couldn't get it to work properly, and
produced far worse results. It does, however, produce a good result, which is
shown in figure \ref{fig:6b} below.

Further adjustments could be made to increase the alpha-channel mask, but the
overall result is somewhat satisfactory as we have managed to capture and
mostly isolated the shape of the flower.
