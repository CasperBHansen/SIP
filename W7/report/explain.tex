\section{Erosion and Dilation as Set Theory}
The dilation ($\oplus$) can be described in set theory as the union of all
points $b \in B$ over each point in $A$, whilst erosion can be described by
the intersection of all points $b \in B$ over each point in the complement of
$A$, or $\bar{A}$.

\begin{align}
    A \oplus B = \bigcup_{b \in B} A_{b}
    \qquad\qquad
    A \ominus B = \bigcap_{b \in B} \bar{A}_{b}
\end{align}
